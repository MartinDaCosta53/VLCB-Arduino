From Duncan:
The list of platforms and their options and limitations:
1. traditional Uno R3 and Nano have 1KB of EEPROM using the original EEPROM library
2. Pico and ESPxx have an EEPROM emulation library but require an explicit EEPROM.begin(size) call
3. external I2C EEPROM works on any platform (needs the I2C address to be set if other than the default)
4. Arduino Due EEPROM emulation
5. other boards with limited EEPROM plus optional flash EEPROM emulation libraries (e.g. Uno R4, AVR-Dx)
6. filesystem-oriented approaches, using various file structures (binary, text, json, etc).

Controlling macros:
------------------
__SAM3X8E__ - EEPROM emulation - DueFlashStorage.h
ARDUINO_ARCH_RP2040 - Pico stuff
DXCORE - Use flash - requires a separate board manager to be installed.
ESP32, ESP8266

EEPROM Types:
------------
EEPROM_INTERNAL
EEPROM_EXTERNAL
EEPROM_USES_FLASH

setEEPROMtype() is only called from examples in CBUS2515. These set to EEPROM_INTERNAL.

Functions that depend on eeprom_type:
readEEPROM
readBytesEEPROM
writeEEPROM
writeBytesEEPROM
resetEEPROM
resetModule(void)

Functions that depend on controlling macros
setChipEEPROMVal
getChipEEPROMVal

Functions only available for DXCORE
flash_cache_page
flash_writeback_page
flash_write_bytes
flash_read_byte
flash_read_bytes

Workflow:
--------
In Storage classes:
readEEPROM - reads one byte at given address
readBytesEEPROM - reads n bytes at given address
writeEEPROM - writes one byte at given address
writeBytesEEPROM - writes n bytes at given address

In CBUSConfig:
readEvent - reads NN+EN for given event index, via readEEPROM() * 4
getEventVal - reads value for given event value for given event index, via readEEPROM()
writeEventEV - writes value for a given event value for a given event index, via readEEPROM()
readNV - reads value for given NV index
writeNV - writes value for given NV index
writeEvent - writes NN+EN for a given event index, via writeBytesEEPROM()

setFLiM - writeEEPROM(0, flag)
setCANID - writeEEPROM(1, canid)
setNodeNum - writeEEPROM(2, high NN), writeEEPROM(3, low NN)
resetModule - various writes.
loadNVs - reads FLiM (i=0), CANID (i=1), NN (i=2,3)
setResetFlag - writeEEPROM(5, 99)
clearResetFlag - writeEEPROM(5, 0)
isResetFlagSet - readEEPROM(5)
